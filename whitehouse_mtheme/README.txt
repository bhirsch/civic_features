About White House Module Theme
-------------------------------
This feature module contains the CSS components from the White House 
theme, and provides these components to the Subtheme module, so they 
can be easily copied, overridden and exported.

Note: 
-------
Once mtheme and subtheme modules are stable, these components should 
really live inside their respective feature modules: 
features[mtheme_selector][] = "menu_item_events"
features[mtheme_selector][] = "menu_item_issues"
features[mtheme_selector][] = "menu_item_legislation"
features[mtheme_selector][] = "menu_item_newsclips"
features[mtheme_selector][] = "menu_item_pressreleases"
features[mtheme_selector][] = "menu_item_staff"
